# raincheck-api
The entire RainCheck Platform has been built from the ground up to be open and fully scalable with all instances running on the AWS Cloud Environment. The modular approach enables our team of engineers to work on separate modules as opportunities or client needs arise. 
<br />

The platform is broken into ten modules that all interconnect and can be run at multiple instances, or individually, depending on the services required at the time. Each system module has been built as open as possible, using the latest tools to ensure a very wide acceptance from almost any third party integration.
<br />

## Product Feed (Online)
The product feed module handles the ingestion of product information data including stock levels from various eCommerce platforms such as Magento, Shopify, Demandware, Neto and many others. The system can also handle existing feeds that service Google, Channel Advisor etc.
<br />

## Inventory Feed (Stores)
The Inventory feed module handles the ingestion of product and inventory information data from ERP systems that handle in-store inventory. In most cases, the data feed is separate from the online data feeds. The RainCheck platform can aggregate this data for the customer.
<br />

## O2O Wishlist
This API allows users to discover a product item online and save it into the Cloud. This can be executed using a simple browser interface or JavaScript integrated button or even a browser extension. The saved product data can include image, description, price and SKU.
<br />

## Payments/Wallets
This module is very important to the entire infrastructure as it involves backend integration to payment scheme API’s, PSP’s and banks. This allows us to offer services within native Apps and/or via third party eWallets. Split payments, Digital receipting and cash-back can also be handled here.
<br />

## Location/Proximity
Our Location Services are handled using Geo-fencing technology, where the average range is set at 150m and covers all shopping centres, shopping precincts and airports. We also offer BLE Beacons to offer Proximity services at a more granular level, 1-40 meters in most cases. These are generally at a store level.
<br />

## Connected POS & Card-Linked Offers
This module is by far the most important and most difficult to build out. This allows us to target offers at SKU level. Being able to match payment data with POS data is a very difficult process, but the data collected from such matches is very rich. This module allows segmented marketing at actual product level.

## Push Notifications
Self executable push notifications are paramount on mobile and the system can now handle all delivery options from a central place. Location based in simple text, rich, in-app or SMS notification, designed uniquely for the requirement on each application.

## Data Analytics
The platform monitors and collects hundreds of data points and stores it all in defined data repositories that can be retrieved, and visually displayed, via out web interfaced Dashboards.
